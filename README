Currently, the best way to get started, on understanding how this project
works, is to look at the LdapOrganizationTest and AnnotationsTest unit tests.
They use most of the "current" functionality available.

I use IDEA's TO-DO tracking.  TODOs are marked with the following...
TODO             - probably obsolete, and should be discontinued
FEATURE          - a good feature to have, but not necessarily core
REQUIRED_FEATURE - a required feature to truly have a "functional" end product
MINOR            - a minor issue to deal with, does not imply small
TEST             - something that needs a test case
DOC              - something that needs better documentation

Currently, I'm not entirely sure how the build process works.  I do know
that I did an "mvn install" on apacheds, by checking out
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/directory/apacheds/tags/1.5.7.  The
libraries don't tend to get up to any maven repos on the net, so you have to
install it locally.

I trust that any other libraries that are needed can be resolved by maven, or
the skill of the person attempting to build this project would come into play.
As an example, oracle has enjoyed removing many libraries from public maven
repos, even their own.  So, you may have to do some manual resolution by
installing them in your local repo.

Then, to run one of the tests, you would go...
mvn -Ptest -Dtest=LdapOrganizationTest install
mvn -Ptest -Dtest=AnnotationsTest install
mvn -Ptest -Dtest=PersonTest install
