There is no website for this project as of yet.  Github is THE place to find
it.

Currently, the best way to get started, on understanding how this project
works, is to look at the unit tests, except the LDAPFactoryTest. They use most
of the "current" functionality available.

I use IDEA's TO-DO tracking.  TODOs are marked with the following...
TODO             - probably obsolete, and should be discontinued
FEATURE          - a good feature to have, but not necessarily core
REQUIRED_FEATURE - a required feature to truly have a "functional" end product
MINOR            - a minor issue to deal with, does not imply small
TEST             - something that needs a test case
DOC              - something that needs better documentation

I trust that all libraries that are needed can be resolved by maven.

So, let's try it out; copy and paste the following commands.

git clone git://github.com/TrentonAdams/lpa.git
cd lpa
mvn -Ptest install

ISSUES
When submitting issues, please include an example ldap entry, or multiple entries,
depending on what is needed to provide the functionality requested, or to fix
the bug suggested.  Also provide schema LDIF files, if you have some sort
of special LDAP schema.  Ultimately, please write a unit test demonstrating
the problem, if it is not trivial.  This can be done easily by forking LPA
from github

Thanks.
